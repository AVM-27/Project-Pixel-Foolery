## 🎯 After Updation

Pixel-level perturbations on Modified ResNet:

- `1_Pixel.jpg` to `5_Pixels.jpg` show increasing degradation
- True class: originally classified correctly with 0.82 confidence
- By 3 pixels, true class confidence drops to 0.00 and misclassification to Dog reaches 1.00

## 📉 Pre Updation (Multi Class)

- `PureCNN-MultiClass.png`: Accuracy degradation on PureCNN (CIFAR-10)
- `RESNET-MultiClass.png`: Accuracy degradation on Modified ResNet (CIFAR-10)
